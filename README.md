# HeartWise
HeartWise is a data-driven statistical analysis project that aims to identify key risk factors for heart disease using exploratory data analysis (EDA), statistical modeling, and machine learning techniques.

📌 Features
✅ Data Preprocessing – Handling missing values with iterative imputation, KNN, and SimpleImputer.
✅ Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) – Insights into age, cholesterol, blood pressure, and other health metrics.
✅ Various Models – Logistic regression, XGBoost, KNN, Random Forest, and Gradient Boosting  to analyze heart disease risk.
✅ Data Visualization – Interactive visualizations with Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Plotly.

🛠️ Tech Stack
Languages: Python (Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Statsmodels)
Data Handling: Iterative Imputer, StandardScaler, Label Encoding
Visualization: Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly

📊 Project Workflow
1️⃣ Data Loading & Preprocessing – Handle missing values, scale features, encode categorical data.
2️⃣ EDA & Visualization – Analyze age, cholesterol, blood pressure, and heart disease correlation.
3️⃣ Statistical Modeling – Build a logistic regression model to identify key risk factors.
4️⃣ Results & Interpretation – Evaluate the significance of various health metrics.
